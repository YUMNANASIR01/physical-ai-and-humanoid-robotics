## Advanced Robotics Concepts

### Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics (IK) is a mathematical process that calculates the joint angles required to position the end effector of a robotic arm at a specific location. This is crucial for tasks like grasping objects, path planning, and manipulation.

### Control Theory

Modern robotics relies heavily on control systems to manage robot behavior. PID controllers, state-space models, and adaptive control algorithms form the foundation of responsive robotic systems.

### SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

SLAM algorithms allow robots to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of their location within that map. This is essential for autonomous navigation.
