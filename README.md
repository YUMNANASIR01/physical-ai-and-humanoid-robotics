## 📖 About The Project

The **Human-Inspired Robotics & Intelligence Guide AI Humanoid Textbook** is a comprehensive, open-source resource designed to serve as a structured learning path and practical reference for anyone engaging with **humanoid robotics and physical AI systems**.

This textbook moves beyond theoretical concepts by providing an integrated view of hardware, control systems, and modern AI/ML techniques as applied to bipedal and anthropomorphic platforms. It is ideally suited for:

* **Hackathon Participants:** Quick-start tutorials and proven project templates.
* **Students & Researchers:** Deep dives into control algorithms and sensor integration.
* **Self-Learners:** A clear, step-by-step approach to mastering the field.

### **Key Goals:**
* To establish a strong foundation in the core concepts of **Physical AI** and **Humanoid Robotics**.
* To offer **practical examples, simulation environments, and tutorials** for hands-on learning.
* To act as a high-quality, readily available reference for academic and personal projects.
